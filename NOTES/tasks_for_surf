* Command for creating a data file that could be emailed to us when
  users are reporting errors.  It would save the command log, message
  window contents, microstructure/skeleton/mesh data files, and input
  files in a temp directory, then tar and compress the directory and
  ask the user to mail it to us as an attachment.
