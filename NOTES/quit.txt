The Shutdown Sequence

GUI Mode

Quit menuitem GUI callback and main window delete event callback are
both common.IO.GUI.quit.queryQuit.
  Displays "Save?" dialog.
  If not cancelled, calls common.quit.cleanup,
    passing common.IO.GUI.quit.shutdown as the 'shutdown' arg.

Text Mode

Menuitem callback is common.quit.quit.  
  Querys user.
  Calls common.quit.cleanup,
    passing common.quit.shutdown as the 'shutdown' arg.


Both Modes

common.quit.cleanup
   shuts down logging
   calls common.quit.waitForThreads via subthread.execute_immortal
      sends switchboard "shutdown" signal
         caught only by gfxwindow which destroys its device and stops animations
      calls subthread.miniThreadManager.quit
         calls MiniThreadManager.stopAll
            calls MiniThread.stop_it for all MiniThreads
               calls ThreadState.cancelThread
         calls ThreadManager.waitForAllThreads
            calls MiniThread.join for all non-immortal MiniThreads
      calls common.IO.threadmanager.threadManager.quit
         calls Worker.stop for all workers
            calls threadstate.impedeProgress
              calls Progress::stop1 for all Progress objects
	         sets Progress::stopped_, which is checked by Progress::stopped,
                   which should be queried by long-running operations
         calls Worker.join for all workers
      runs the shutdown function on the main thread

GUI Mode

common.IO.GUI.quit.shutdown
  gui.stop (common.IO.GUI.oofGUI.stop)
    destroy layer editor
    close gfx windows
    destroy console
    close activity viewer
    destroy message windows
    gtk.main_quit
      calls guitop.setMainLoop(False) after exiting
  gui.destroy
  common.quit.shutdown

Text Mode

common.quit.shutdown
  restore system excepthook
  delete mainthreadstate
  sys.exit
