2D - short term, for version 2.1
* Complete moving nonlinear properties to OOFEXTENSIONS, with documentation.
* Non-linear SS22 code is complete, but is untested.
* Add regression tests for static and time-dependent nonlinear problems.
* Solutions of nonlinear plane flux equations.
* Ramberg-Osgood plasticity, as an extension in the OOFEXTENSIONS CVS.
* Static field initialization for non-linear time-dependent problems.
* Update user documentation for time-dependence and non-linearity.
* Review FruitProperty extension and instructions, make sure they're right.
* Ensure all flux-type properties have a flux_value function, and
    modify Material::find_fluxdata to use it.

2D - longer term
* Clean separation of the force and flux properties.
* Plasticity & constraint equations.
* Convert graphics from gnomecanvas to vtk/OpenGL.
* Convert Skeleton to C++.
* Some image segmentation and meshing algorithms.
* Documentation of the algorithms and the code for nonlinearity.

3D
* Boundary conditions.
* Automatic Skeleton construction.
* Finish Skeleton modification operations.
* Exact solution comparisions in regression tests.

2D & 3D
* Time dependent boundary conditions.  (For 2.1?)
* Parallelize.
* Comparisons to exact solution in regression tests.
* Surface physics.  (For 2.1???)
* Get rid of the layer editor window.
* Image analysis for grain boundary detection.
* Package for deb, fink, etc.  (For 2.1?)

Other things that could be done at some point
* Periodic flux boundary conditions, via Lagrange multipliers.
* Plane-flux boundary equations with non-zero rhs.

* Command for creating a data file that could be emailed to us when
  users are reporting errors.  It would
  save the command log, message window contents,
  microstructure/skeleton/mesh data files, and input files in a temp
  directory, then tar and compress the directory and ask the user to
  mail it to us as an attachment.
