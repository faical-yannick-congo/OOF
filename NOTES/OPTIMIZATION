Optimization opportunities:

Rewrite all code in assembler.


Lots of calls to MV_Vector_double::operator=(const double &), when
the flux matrix is being initialized for each Gausspoint.  This
is an artifact of the former-template-ness of the MV routines,
and can probably be sped up with a BLAS call.  Alternatively,
it might be worthwhile to re-use, rather than re-allocate, the
flux matrix.  

The Boundary classes (PointBoundary and EdgeBoundary)  have
methods, getFixedNodes and getFloatNodes, which return lists of
BCInstance objects containing the boundary condition and unevaluated
profiles.  These are all references to pre-existing objects, but 
the boundary condition data in these lists is always 
redundant, and the profile data is often redundant, although
in the general case you might have different functions 
associated with each key of a DiscreteProfile.
  The routines are called to *check* for intersections, so even
if boundaries don't intersect, you have to pay the storage-overhead
cost.  If memory gets tight, this is a place to save some.



Elements currently compute their areas by integration.  Simple elements
should override the "area" function and just return the answer.


Outputs that have to use a particular derived Property class have to
call Material.fetchProperty.  fetchProperty goes through some swig
tricks to get a Python object of the derived Property class.  The
results of fetchProperty could be cached with the Material.  Perhaps
each Output could have a separate data cache in each Material.


Fluxes and Properties check whether or not they're computable too
often.  For example, Material::find_fluxmatrix calls
Property::active() for each output point.  The Material should have
cached this result at the beginning of the Output calculation and not
bother checking each time.

On a related topic, some Outputs should cache their results and know
when those results are out of date.  Then there would be no overhead
in switching from one Stress component to another, for example, or in
plotting more than one at a time.  Good candidates for caching are
Field and Flux Outputs.  Bad candidates are components and other
things easily derived.
