This is the README file for OOF2ABAQUS.

OOF2ABAQUS converts data files (.goof files) created by PPM2OOF or OOF
into input files for abaqus.  Only the geometrical information is
converted.  That is, the abaqus input file will contain the positions
of the nodes, the definitions of the elements (as lists of nodes), the
nodes contained in each node group ("nset"), and the elements
contained in each element group ("elset").  For each material
used in the .goof file, oof2abaqus creates new element sets called
"material-1", "material-2", and so on.  It issues "solid section"
commands for each of these element sets, assigning to them materials
named "material-1", "material-2", and so on.  The header of the output
file lists the OOF material corresponding to each new material name.

What OOF2ABAQUS does *not* do is to assign material properties to the
material names used in the "solid section" commands.  It does not
assign boundary conditions or distortions. 

OOF2ABAQUS only works with .goof files created by the elastic versions
of OOF and PPM2OOF. It will not work with the thermal versions.  Since
it doesn't assign any material properties, this should not be a
problem.  You can always choose to assign thermal properties within
abaqus.

OOF2ABAQUS was created by hacking out all of the computations from the
OOF code, and adding some lines to write the abaqus file.  Tjerefore, it
is an ugly kludge, and may or may not be kept up-to-date with changes
in the OOF code.  On the other hand, there's not much in it that will
need to be changed.


USAGE:

oof2abaqus [options] inputfile.goof

The options are:

      -e        Include empty elements
      -6        Use six node triangles, instead of 3 node triangles
      -o file   Send output to the file, instead of to stdout
      -v        Print version number
