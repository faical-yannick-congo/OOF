// Shape function base class. Derived classes must:
// (1)
//      provide two functions that compute the function and its
//      derivatives at a given point in the master element coordinates
// and (2)
//      invoke the precompute() function in their
//      constructor. precompute() takes a MasterElement as an
//      argument.  The MasterElement corresponding to this shape
//      function will call the shapefunction's constructor from its
//      own constructor. precompute() can't be called in the
//      constructor for the ShapeFunction base class, because it uses
//      virtual functions that are only defined in the derived
//      classes.
