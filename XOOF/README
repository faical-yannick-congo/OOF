This directory contains the source code for the THERMAL version OOF.
It was created by modifying Edwin Garcia's piezoelectric OOF, since
the Poisson equation for electric potential is virtually the same as
the diffusion equation for temperature.  NOT ALL OF THE VARIABLE NAMES
WERE CHANGED.  Therefore, in the code, "phi", "voltage", and
"temperature" all refer to the same thing.

This version is a stopgap, intended to let us do thermal calculations
with OOF 1. There are many things in it that aren't pretty, since the
original OOF wasn't intended to deal with multiple fields.  We don't
recommend extending this version to add new fields.  Wait for OOF 2.
